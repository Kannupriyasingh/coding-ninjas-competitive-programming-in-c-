nim sum
it is used to predict which player will win in an imparitial game.
so there is a pile game 

so to predict which player will win we need to find nim sum and for that we need to take cumalative XOR of piles
for example
first pile - 2
second pile - 4
third pile - 5
then nim sum = 2^4^5
if nim sum == 0 then player 1 will lose
if nim sum != 0 then player 1 will win
condition that both player are playing optimally
